# Canadian-Currency-Classifier

Canadian-Currency-Classifier (iOS - Swift)
The Canadian Currency Classifier is an iOS project built using the Swift programming language. It leverages cutting-edge technologies and machine learning to recognize and classify Canadian currency accurately.

The core of the project utilizes deep learning algorithms, allowing the model to learn and make predictions based on a comprehensive dataset of Canadian banknote images. With the power of Swift, the project offers a user-friendly and efficient implementation for recognizing various denominations of Canadian currency.

To ensure seamless integration into iOS applications, the Canadian Currency Classifier takes advantage of relevant technologies and frameworks such as:

Core ML: The model is optimized for deployment on Apple devices using Core ML, which enables high-performance machine learning inference on iOS devices.

Vision Framework: By utilizing the Vision framework, the project gains access to powerful computer vision algorithms and tools, facilitating image analysis and recognition.

UIKit: The user interface of the iOS project is built using UIKit, Apple's robust framework for developing visually appealing and interactive applications.

Xcode: The project is developed within Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), providing a comprehensive set of tools for building, debugging, and testing iOS applications.

The Canadian Currency Classifier repository on GitHub includes the necessary code, documentation, and resources to help you get started with integrating this classifier into your iOS app. It provides clear instructions on how to install dependencies, load the pre-trained model, and utilize it for Canadian currency classification.

Feel free to explore and extend the project, making use of Swift's versatility to enhance its functionality or integrate it with other features. Together, we can continue to improve the accuracy and performance of the Canadian Currency Classifier, enabling a wide range of applications and use cases for Canadian currency recognition on iOS devices.
